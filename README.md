# **Customer Segmentation with Unsupervised Learning**

In this data analysis project, I've meticulously analyzed and cleaned a customer transaction dataset, shedding light on the intricacies of customer behavior and preferences. Utilizing unsupervised learning techniques, including K-Means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method, we've uncovered valuable insights into customer segmentation.

**Key Features:**

- **K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering:** Explore different methods of grouping customers based on their transaction patterns and behaviors.

- **RFM Analysis:** Dive deep into customer segments using the RFM method to understand their recency, frequency, and monetary value to your business.

**What to Expect:**

- Comprehensive insights into the distinct customer groups within your dataset.
- Actionable strategies for personalized marketing and customer retention.
- A practical showcase of unsupervised learning techniques applied to real-world customer data.

This project is a testament to the power of data analysis in understanding and optimizing customer relationships. Whether you're in e-commerce, retail, or any customer-centric industry, the knowledge gained from this analysis can drive data-driven decision-making and enhance the customer experience.
